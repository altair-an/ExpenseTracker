### About
This is an ongoing passion project done by a friend and I as a practical implementation of what we have learned as first year CS 
majors. As avid travelers, we would often need to keep track of our expenses and budget on our trips. Often times, we would find 
ourselves paying for one another in varying situations, which gave rise to the idea for this application. 

This app is essentially an expense tracker that is able to properly track and split expenses amongst participants, depending on 
who helps pay, and how much each participant is responsible for on the bill. The app will then store the debts owed under each 
participant, and keep a long-standing tracker of the exact credits of each person.

The project is ongoing and we plan to continue working on and adding functionality as we continue to learn more in our CS curriculum.
Our intention is to eventually implement a GUI for this project for full functionality and capability for more general and ease of use.

### Completed
Core functionality of the application has been completed, namely, the Expense object and it's implementation has been completed and
functioning as intended.

### In Progress
Currently looking to implement the menus needed to access the expense objects and add functionality surrounding it.
